# Code For Canada Challenge

## Language: Ruby
## Author: Chris Larsen

This command line tool parses a CSV of building code violations, and presents the information in two ways. First, it gives the number of violations in each category. Second, the first and last violations, by date.

## Usage

The CSV file must be located in the same folder as the codeForCanada.rb program. Navigate to that directory in your terminal, and then execute with:

```
$ ruby codeForCanada.rb
```

The program will print out the necessary information to your terminal.
